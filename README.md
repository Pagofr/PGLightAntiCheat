PGLightAntiCheat, or short PGLAC, is a lightweigt, fast and stable Anti Cheat plugin for Minecraft Servers

This is an updated Version of LightAntiCheat from https://github.com/VeksterGitHub/LightAntiCheat

Please don't expect new Anti Cheat checks from me (pagofr),
as I don't understand this complicated topic well enough.

Warning: the permission lightanticheat.alerts got replaced with lightanticheat.alerts.* please change that in your permissions.
Also: the update function doesn't work (yet)
